| Full qualified VSS Path: | `Vehicle.Safety.Rollover` |
| Description: | Indicates whether the vehicle has rolled over or is at risk of rollover. |
| Comment: | May be derived from Vehicle.AngularVelocity, Vehicle.Orientation.Roll, and Vehicle.Orientation.Pitch signals. NONE indicates normal orientation. RISK indicates the vehicle is at elevated risk of rollover. DETECTED indicates a rollover event has occurred. UNKNOWN shall be used when the system cannot assess rollover status. Criteria for each state may be OEM specific. Primary consumers: emergency dispatch and first responder systems. Related to VSS issue #877 (Connected Safety signals).

## About VSS

The [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) (VSS)
is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
