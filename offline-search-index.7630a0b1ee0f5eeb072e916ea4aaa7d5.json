[{"body":"The Eclipse Leda project will provide system image “recipes” to deliver a functional Linux-based image/distribution in the context of SDV (Software Defined Vehicle), by pulling together individual contributons from the SDV and the larger OSS community.\nThe Eclipse Leda distribution will work with build scripts, package definitions, image build pipelines, etc, with the goal to pull SDV projects and dependecies from the larger OSS community into a working Linux system. Such system images (or other useful forms of delivery, as determined by the project) will be made available for consumption for anyone who is interested in working with the SDV tech stack. These deliveries take the form of container (base) images, installable/flashable image files, etc (again to be evolved by the project team according to community needs). Also in scope is concise and useful documentation for consumers of the project’s deliverables, plus a method of delivering that documentation.\nIn the context described above - the ambition of SDV to build a technology ecosystem for software-defined vehicle concern - a prime challenge will be the combination of these initially diverse components into a coherent and useful whole: all the software components in the world will not have the impact needed to transform the automotive industry unless we can make them play together coherently an form a functional portfolio. As a first step towards that goal, this proposal (Eclipse Leda) is for a “SDV distribution” project that pulls together individual contributor pieces from SDV and the larger OSS community, to deliver a functional and always-available Linux-based image/distribution with two primary goals:\n  be the crystalization point for functionally integrating diverse SDV-scope projects into a working whole\n  deliver a continually available, always working starting image for developers interested in getting going with the SDV tech stack\n  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Eclipse Leda project will provide system image “recipes” to …","ref":"/docs/about/","tags":"","title":"About Leda"},{"body":"Setting up GitHub Codespaces Git Authentication For private repositories, we need to separately authenticate against the submodule repositories, as GitHub Codespaces will only inject a token with access rights to the current repository.\n  Change to the users home directory\ncd ~   Install https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager\ncurl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/main/src/linux/Packaging.Linux/install-from-source.sh \u0026\u0026 sh ./install-from-source.sh \u0026\u0026 git-credential-manager-core configure   Configure a credential store typ, e.g. git config --global credential.credentialStore plaintext\n  Verify with git config --global -l, it should show git-credential-manager-core as the credential helper.\n  Update the submodules Run git submodule update --recursive\nSee https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/109050 for details.\nSetup skopeo Skopeo is needed to download various files during the build:\nsudo mkdir -p /run/containers/1000 sudo chmod a+w /run/containers/1000 skopeo login ghcr.io --authfile ~/auth.json --username \u003cyour GitHub User\u003e Enter your token when asked for the password.\nRun the build Now the actual build can be started:\ncd /workspace/leda-distro/poky source oe-init-build-env ../build-sdv-x86_64/ cd /workspace/leda-distro ./build-x86_64.sh Run qemu Start qemu with the new image:\nrunqemu qemux86-64 nographic slirp qemuparams=\"-m 2048\" Start the k3s pods Create the secret ConnectionString for the cloudconnector:\nkubectl create secret generic cloudagent \\  --from-literal=PrimaryConnectionString='\u003c\u003c\u003cConnectionString\u003e\u003e\u003e' Create the secret needed to pull images from ghcr:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-io \\  --docker-server=ghcr.io \\  --docker-username=\u003cyour github username\u003e \\  --docker-password=\u003cyour github personal access token\u003e check the pods, you should now have them running:\nroot@qemux86-64:~# kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE sdv-core-vehicle-update-manager-pod 1/1 Running 1 127m mosquitto-76bcf4956f-bpncv 1/1 Running 1 127m cloud-connector 1/1 Running 18 37m Subscribe to a topic with the mosquitto in the pod: kubectl exec --stdin --tty mosquitto -- /bin/sh mosquitto_sub -v -t '#' ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Setting up GitHub Codespaces Git Authentication For private …","ref":"/docs/build/devenv/github-codespaces/github-codespaces-advanced/","tags":"","title":"Advanced topics"},{"body":"Note: The configuration mentioned in this chapter is already enabled in the run-leda.sh script.\nQEMU General documentation about using CAN-Bus in Qemu: https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/devices/can.html\nEnabling Virtual CAN Bus interfaces (vcan) No special parameters are necessary for qemu, as vcan is virtual:\nrunqemu qemux86-64 nographic slirp qemuparams=\"-m 2048\" Bring interface up:\nip link add dev vcan0 type vcan ip link set vcan0 up Enabling CAN Bus interfaces (can) Standalone CAN within Qemu To run a standalone CAN setup, qemu must be instructed to emulate a specific CAN hardware device.

For vehicle software systems, there are a lot of requirements to consider. Some of these requirements are taken into account for Leda’s quickstart setups, thereas some other requirements can only be met once in a production environment and by customizing the target device image.\nThe following document will list some of these requirements and give an explanation on why they are met in the Leda quickstart distribution.\nOverview  Provide an example operating system and configuration for constrained in-vehicle devices Integrate software-defined-vehicle Open Source components to showcase the available features and their state of maturity Demonstrate the use and interaction of open protocols and specifications, such as  the Kubernetes specifications OpenTelemetry specs and components Eclipse IoT related specifications for software rollouts and digital twin representations open specifications from the The Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA)    Background Information    Requirement Met Context information     Footprint Constraints Yes Embedded in-vehicle devices have constrained resources such as CPU power, disk space, memory etc. Desktop operating systems use as much space as possible, thereas in-vehicle operating systems are as small as possible, omitting a lot of unnecessary tooling such as package managers or convenience tools for administrators, documenation (man pages) etc. Leda provides two different types of operating system images: one for quickstart and demo cases with some tooling, and a another minimal image which only contains the necessary software components for remote usage. \nSDV Rescue Image is about 130MB\nSDV Minimal Image is about 300MB SDV Full Image (with convenience tools and pre-cached containers) is about 900MB\nNote: Future roadmap includes more footprint optimizations   Hardened system Partly A vehicle device and its operating system are vulnerable targets in the same way as any other computer, especially once they are connected to the internet. Classically, such in-vehicle devices were hardened down once with additional audit logging for any kind of network traffic. In a connected world, these devices now become mostly always-on devices and behave like any other Internet of Things devices. Special care is to be taken to guard them against vulnerabilities by keeping these devices up-to-date, establish continuous automated monitoring and other methodologies known from DevSecOps.\nAs Leda is supposed to be used for quickly starting and evaluating SDV software, we balance these type of requirements. For example, installing system updates in Leda is only possible with signed update bundles, but the demo uses a self-signed certificate. For production use, these self-signed certificates would of course be replaced by the manufacturer’s real certificates.

While one partition is the actively booted partition and in use, the other partition can be updated by writing a partition image to it, as it is unused or inactive.\nOnce the download and writing is done, a reboot is triggered and the boot loader will now switch to the newly updated partition.\nIf the booting of the updated partition fails, the self update mechanism can revert back to the previous partition or boot to a rescue partition.\nAs updating the running operating system cannot be done at runtime, the approach requires additional disk space, a second partition and also requires the device to be rebooted for the updates to take effect.\nIn a vehicle, the self-updater cannot decide on its own when to do a reboot, as the vehicle must be in a safe condition (eg parked, state of charge etc.). Hence, the trigger for performaing the switch to another slot and a subsequent reboot is handed over to a higher level component, such as the vehicle update manager, which may in turn rely on driver feedback or other conditions.\nImplementation with RAUC Update Service RAUC is a lightweight update client that runs on your embedded device and reliably controls the procedure of updating your device with a new firmware revision.\nFor general usage of the RAUC tool, please see the RAUC User manual\nReference configuration The project contains an example reference implementation and configuration using RAUC, which allows the evaluation of the concepts, mechanisms and involved software components in an emulated, virtual environment.\nThe Leda quickstart image contains the following disk partitions:\n a small rescue partition a full SDV installation with a Kubernetes Control Plane (Server + Agent as single node), pre-loaded SDV container images and deployment specifications and additional developer tools such as nerdctl and k9s. a minimal SDV installation with a Kubernetes Control Plane (Server + Agent as single node), but no additional examples or developer tools. This partition is used to demonstrate the self-update functionality. additional boot and data partitions for keeping system state information  *Note: All three rootfs partitions (rootfs) initially contain the same identical copies of the base operating system.

It is provided as an information source for your solution-specific data protection and data privacy topics. This is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for legal advice.\nYour Role First things first: when you choose and use our software, you are most likely acting in the role of data controller, if personal related data is being processed. Therefore, you must ensure that the processing of personal data complies with the respective local legal requirements, e.g. when processing data within the scope of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the legal requirements for a controller from the GDPR.\nWhere may the processing of personal related data be relevant? When using our software in combination with other software components, personal data or data categories may be collected for the purpose of developing, testing and running in-vehicle applications (Vehicle Apps). Possible examples are the vehicle identification number (VIN), the number plate, GPS data, video data, audio data, or other measurement data. You can determine which data or data categories are collected when configuring the software. These data are stored in volatile memory and are deleted by shutting down the system. You are responsible for the compliant handling of the data in accordance with the applicable local law.\nWhat have we done to make the software data protection friendly? This section describes the measures taken to integrate the requirements of the data protection directly into the software development.
